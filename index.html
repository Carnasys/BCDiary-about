            <h1>Benedictus Juve & Christine</h1>
            <p>
                Benedictus Juve (01-11-01) and Christine (19-05-00) have been officially dating since December 24, 2023, during their coass days. They got close during pre-clinical times only from chats and became closer in 2022. Benedictus had feelings for Christine since around 2018, but he kept them to himself because Christine had a boyfriend at that time. Christine was the first to say 'I love you' in 2023 during public health. Both of them will become doctors after the Hippocratic oath in July/August and will be in a long-distance relationship for years.
